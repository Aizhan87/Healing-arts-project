                <p>The Healing Arts Center was created as an invitation for people to experience positive change spiritually, physically, and mentally.  The Healing Arts Center is one of the businesses that people use as a stepping stone to get somewhere else like acting, personal assistant, dream job, marriage etc.</p>
                <p>
                    The intentions of the Healing Arts Center are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            To create a sanctuary that promotes healing, nurturing, motivation, and creativity.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To promote a safe, non-judgmental, and accepting enviroment that allows whoever enters to express themselves and release any fears, stress, or long-term baggage.
                        </li>
                        <li>To honor the safe space and anyone who enters.</li>
                        <li>To allow an abundance of peace to flow through the space.</li>
                        <li>To bless and cleanse the space, creating a light that brings people their spiritual, emotional, or physical healing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p><br>
